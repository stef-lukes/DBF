                <p>At Direct Business Finance we work differently to our competitors, we only deal directly with
                    underwriters and decision makers, therefore no lengthy processing procedures and delays, no
                    middlemen and no business development managers. We work extremely fast to achieve results. Here at
                    Direct Business Finance, we pride ourselves in getting the very best deals for our clients and
                    securing funds quickly. Because of our long-standing connections and over 28 years of close ties
                    with our private investment funders, we are in a very unique position to evaluate and secure funding
                    where other brokers fail.</p>
                <p>Our dedicated experienced team of financial experts will search endlessly to source and secure a deal

                    specialise in and what we do extremely well. We remove the laborious hurdles associated with
                    commercial finance, namely, meeting inflexible lenders’ criteria who select the safest circumstances
                    and also waiting several days for lending committee deliberations. At Direct Business Finance we
                    fully understand the importance and emphasis of presenting an application in a manner that is
                    favourable to lenders since this is where many commercial brokers fall down.</p>

            <div class="column">

                    Additionally, our team is backed up by commercial Lawyers and registered Chartered Accountants. We
                    offer the complete package to make the finance process as smooth as possible. At Direct Business
                    Finance we have built a very successful business by sticking to our 3 core values; offering

                    working alongside a trusted network of funders that understand our clients’ needs. So, whatever your
                    funding requirements are, whether they be short-term or long-term finance, we are here to help
                    regardless of your status, credit or unusual requirements.</p>

                    <p>
                        Secured Finance is when the borrower has given their consent for a lender to place a legal
                        charge over a certain asset or assets, such as a property, a vehicle or other tangible items
                        which hold value. If the client serially defaults in payment, the lender has the legal right
                        to seize control of the asset and sell it to settle the balance of the loan outstanding.
                        There is a lower risk for a lender to offer secured finance and this should be reflected in
                        the pay rate. Lenders quite often ask for some form of security if profit margins are tight,
                        or if they want slightly more comfort with the arrangement to lend. With further security
                        and increased lender comfort, lower interest rates are acquired for our clients.

                        Long Term Secured Finance ideally this is the funding we like to provide for our clients,
                        first time around, if time permits. The more time our clients have at their disposal to plan
                        their future financial requirements and the business direction they wish to take, the lower
                        the rate and lender fees.

                    <p>Tier One, high street commercial lenders require their loan facilities to be
                        repaid over a set number of years and will not countenance interest only arrangements apart
                        from possibly the first year of the loan term. Tier One lenders are risk averse, they offer
                        extremely good rates but they ‘cherry pick’, low risk applications, at low loan to values
                        (LTV) and take an age to make decisions and process an application. We have access to a
                        myriad of long-term commercial lenders who do not take several days to make a decision, who
                        offer high LTV’s, keen rates and interest only options (to increase an applicant’s
                        affordability and in turn this increases the amount of loan available).</p>

                        From 3 to 60 months, normally utilised because you require funds quickly, this can be purely
                        equity, based lending without the requirement to prove income, with interest compounded
                        monthly or a serviced facility, if income proof is available. Exit of the facility is via
                        disposal of assets or refinance to a long term commercial secured mortgage.

                        An unsecured loan is issued and supported by the borrower’s creditworthiness and ability to
                        pay, rather than by any type of collateral. In some cases, our lenders may request a PG
                        (Personal Guarantee). Although the borrower becomes personally liable in a default position,
                        the facility is still classified as unsecured as there is no specified security attributed
                        to the loan. Unsecured requests are the fastest applications to be underwritten and draw
                        down can be within 24 hours.

        <div class="column">
            <p>Obtaining a commercial mortgage when you have bad credit is not easy, but that doesn’t mean it’s out of
                reach; and while the range of commercial lenders willing to consider adverse is certainly narrower, they
                nevertheless exist. Furthermore, we may be able to help customers who have suffered a range of credit
                issues, from late payments to bankruptcy—even repossession.
            </p>
            <p>The key point here is that while everyone’s circumstances are different, rarely are they insurmountable.
                That said, you may still wonder if we can help with your particular situation.
            </p>
            <h5>Frequently Asked Questions:</h5>
            <p class="faq-quote">“I was turned down for a commercial mortgage for having bad credit—how is it that you
                are able to help?”
            </p>
            <p class="top-paragraph">Lenders may turn you away simply because you don’t fit their lending criteria, or perhaps they were
                approached during a period in which their “appetite for risk” suddenly changed—it happens. Some will
                provide you with a straight no while others may make it difficult for you to accept by offering you
                unsustainably high repayment terms. Conversely, we may be able to introduce you to specialist commercial
                or private funders, those able to take a broader view with a different, more lenient approach to adverse
                credit, balancing the history and degree of your bad credit against the viability of your project.</p>
            <p class="faq-quote">“My credit file shows a number of defaults in the past—am I still able to get a
                business mortgage?”</p>
            <p class="top-paragraph">There’s no question that defaulting on your repayments will not be taken lightly. But the circumstances
                that gave rise to the situation, the length of time that has since passed, and how you have conducted
                yourself in the interim are all factors that can be taken into account. Furthermore, a bad credit report
                doesn’t necessarily imply you lack the income or ability to service the repayments—and many lenders know
                this.
            </p>
            <p class="faq-quote">
                “My debts spiralled out of control, my business has been made bankrupt, and I lost my property—how can I
                possibly be trusted with another commercial mortgage?”
            </p>
            <p class="top-paragraph">When deciding whether to underwrite a project not every decision is made by a computer algorithm, nor is
                it left to gut-feeling. The deciding factors are more likely to come down to how well a “business case”
                can be packaged and presented ready for the loan application to be assessed by the underwriter.
            </p>
            <p>There can be no doubt that circumstances like these will warrant additional scrutiny, yet one should be
                mindful that any stipulations a lender may make are there to offset the additional risk they may have to
                assume. The following may help to provide focus:
            </p>
            <h5>Affordability</h5>
            <p class="top-paragraph">Lenders will take a view on the income that your commercial project may generate. If the numbers stack up
                this will lend credence to your application. If confidence is high that your venture can make the
                repayments, there’s a greater likelihood of being offered better rates.

            <h5 id="ltv">Loan-to-Value (LTV)</h5>
            <p class="top-paragraph">It’s common to find business mortgages being offered at between 60-75%. In some circumstances this can
                even be 80%. This is the ratio of how much you are borrowing against the value of the property—the
                loan-to-value.
            </p>
            <p>In the case of an investment property the amount will be determined by the rental income—but this will
                may not exceed 65% of the purchase price. When buying a business that includes stock, fixtures, and
                goodwill, then the loan amount will reduce further still.
            </p>
            <p>Needless-to-say, the balance of the purchase price after the loan will still need to be found in the form
                of a deposit. Furthermore, if you have “additional security,” perhaps a residential property or other
                assets you hold equity in, then these can be put up to minimise the lender’s risk.</p>
            <p class="faq-quote">“What if even after managing to get a commercial mortgage or development finance with
                all my bad credit I
                still need more money?”</p>
            <p class="top-paragraph">In spite of the fact that some specialist lenders will go out of their way to help, sometimes the figures
                don’t quite meet your requirements. It could be argued that if the lender has done a thorough appraisal
                of the viability of the business and the associated risks, perhaps even attempting to mitigate those
                risks by placing a charge on your additional property then there’s nothing more to be done.
            </p>
            <p>That’s certainly sound commercial sense. But what if it’s close? Very close, but the lending policy just
                won’t allow that little bit extra, after all they have to draw the line somewhere. Well let’s just say
                they’re not the only shop in town.
            </p>
            <p>If the circumstances require it, we may be able to introduce you to another source of lending: Mezzanine
                Finance. What is it? Mezzanine finance allows one to borrow for a property or business investment, it
                uses both debt and equity. That means you pay the lender interest, but you also give the lender a small
                stake in the project.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, this option is the most common and often chosen by our clients; we can provide access to
                non-bank business funders i.e. Private Business Lenders, which we are extremely well placed and well
                connected in this field.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike equity investors these private funders don’t require you to give away a proportion of your
                company. Private business lending can fill the gap left by traditional lending institutions. Oftentimes
                they have fewer constraints when underwriting and structuring a business loan facility. This extra
                flexibility comes at cost. Since traditional routes take lower risks, they can offer lower rates; but if
                your needs are such that a private funder steps in, then just to be clear: you pose a higher risk and
                will pay a slightly higher rate.
